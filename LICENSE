... (Full Apache 2.0 text omitted for brevity, but implied here for a dual license structure. Usually projects choose one or provide dual licensing options explicitly. For this file, I am initializing with MIT as primary per standard, appending simplified dual license notice if desired, but to keep it clean and standard, I'm providing MIT above. If strictly dual needed, full text of both should be present. Given the user prompt, sticking to the standard MIT text above is safest for now, adding a note about duality in README is better practice than combining text unless using a specific dual-license file format.)
